# Week 3

## Learn by doing

> Micro-scripts must be taught in the service of a goal, or to put this more clearly, they ought not be taught at all. They need to be learned naturally in the course of the pursuit of a goal. This is what learning by doing is all about. [What We Learn When We Learn by Doing](http://cogprints.org/637/1/LearnbyDoing_Schank.html)
* During the assignment, I focused on writing just enough test code to meet the requirements.
* My gut feeling told me that tests are useful when code changes, which means test code will also change.
* I realized that test coverage would be adequate criteria for determining how much test code to write.
* I will write sufficient amounts of test code from now on, learning through the process.

## Make blueprints

> React has revolutionized web development by abstracting away the details of DOM manipulation. That conceptual elegance has opened the door to a new generation of web testing: clear, expressive, and lightning-fast. That makes React a perfect fit for test-driven development (TDD), a methodology in which tests are a blueprint instead of an afterthought. [Test-Driven React](https://pragprog.com/titles/tbreact/test-driven-react/)
* Some feedback on this assignment describes test code as a blueprint.
* What an exciting idea, I thought.
* I learned that this view is characteristic of test-driven development (TDD).
* I will try out TDD.

## Think BDD

> I found the shift from thinking in tests to thinking in behaviour so profound that I started to refer to TDD as BDD, or behaviour-driven development. [Introducing BDD](https://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/)
* I encountered the terms TDD and BDD.
* My curiosity took over, and I started to read about BDD.
* I learned that BDD is about testing an object's interface.
* I will keep this way of thinking in mind when I write tests.
