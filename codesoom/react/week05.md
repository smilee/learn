# Week 5

## Beware of the Dunning-Kruger effect

> People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains.  [Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.64.2655)
* I was able to finish the assignment without some tests.
* Previous practices helped me gain confidence in my test writing abilities, but this week's stripped me of it.
* However, I learned that writing test code can get more complicated than what I had experienced so far.
* I will keep in mind that there is more to just about anything than what it seems.

## Ask for help

> Social support may moderate genetic and environmental vulnerabilities and confer resilience to stress, possibly via its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system, the noradrenergic system, and central oxytocin pathways. [Social Support and Resilience to Stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921311/)
* This week's assignment took longer than anticipated. 
* Ever-increasing amounts of stress overwhelmed me.
* Sharing my situation with others and the social support that followed helped me regain peace of mind.
* I will ask for, as well as give, social support.

## Know what you are doing

> to have the skills and knowledge to do something effectively [know what you are doing](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/know-what-you-are-doing)
* Every assignment requires that I apply something new.
* It felt like I was making a lot of progress because I was using new things.
* However, I learned that writing better test code requires a good understanding of the subject.
* I will take more time to understand my code.
