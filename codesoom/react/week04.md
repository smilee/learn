# Week 4

## Ask

> Don't Make Assumptions. Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life. - Don Miguel Ruiz
* Second assignment's instructions were not clear, but I guessed what I should be doing.
* I felt uncomfortable doing the assignment.
* With feedback, I realized that I had misinterpreted a vital part of the assignment - committing each step of TDD.
* I will learn to ask to avoid misunderstandings.

## Write pure functions

> A pure function is a function that, given the same input, will always return the same output and does not have any observable side effect. [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide/blob/master/ch03.md)
* One feedback called for pure functions.
* I was intrigued by the idea.
* Pure functions are reliable.
* I will utilize pure functions as much as possible.

## Separate presentational components from container components

> React bindings for Redux separate presentational components from container components. This approach can make your app easier to understand and allow you to more easily reuse components. [Presentational and Container Components](https://redux.js.org/basics/usage-with-react#presentational-and-container-components)
* The assignments required that I use redux.
* It was my first time using redux, but I was determined to make things work.
* One lecture mentioned the separation of presentational components from container components.
* I will keep this separation in mind when I use redux.
