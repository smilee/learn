# Week 1

## Contribute to the community
> Great ambition and conquest without contribution is without significance. What will your contribution be? How will history remember you? ― William Hundert - The Emperors Club
- [I contributed to the CodeSoom repository.](https://github.com/CodeSoom/git-training/pull/23) :+1:
- [I fixed a typo in the Codeceptjs repository.](https://github.com/codeceptjs/CodeceptJS/pull/2588) :+1:
- I am glad I could help.
- "Help others; help yourself."
- I will continue to contribute whenever I can.

## Work hard
> The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary. - Vidal Sassoon
- I spent more time on the assignments than I had initially planned.
- Neglecting other commitments felt horrible but accomplished at the same time.
- Deliberate practice pays off.
- I will strive to keep up the hard work.

## Focus on the bigger picture
> I don’t focus on what I’m up against. I focus on my goals and I try to ignore the rest. - Venus Williams
- I forgot what I was trying to do because I got distracted by other requirements.
- I regretted making many commits right after pushing them because there was a mismatch between the code and the commit message.
- In git, adding `--fixup` during a commit will add `!fixup` to the beginning of the commit message of the commit being fixed. An interactive rebase with the `--autosquash` option enabled will then squash the two commits together.
- I force pushed several times to amend mistakes and felt conflicted about them because they rewrite commit history.
- I dreaded the miscommunication and the waste of energy that happened due to careless commits.
- I will double-check all commits before making them.

## Learn from others
> Fools say that they learn by experience. I prefer to profit by others experience. - Otto von Bismarck
- For the calculator assignment, I discovered that an error passed the given tests.
- I added a new test to see whether pressing the '=' operator resets the operation.
- The test would pass although it should not, and I was frustrated.
- By looking through the given test code, I learned that the test `I.see()` applies to anything on the page.
- I will be specific when I write tests to avoid the problem I encountered above.

## Keep things up to date
> Updates contain important changes to improve the performance, stability and security of the applications that run on your computer. Installing them ensures that your software continues to run safely and efficiently. Keep in mind that many web exploits look for outdated software with unpatched security flaws.
[Why Updating Your Software is a Must Do](https://www.techlicious.com/tip/why-you-should-update-software-when-prompted/)
- I tried to set up the given assignment on my computer. 
- `npm` threw an error, and I panicked.
- `puppeteer` will not install on lower versions of `node`.
- I will keep `node` up to date.
