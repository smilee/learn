## `let` and `const` vs. `var`

- `var` declarations are globally scoped or function scoped whereas `let` and `const` are block scoped.
- `var` and `let` declarations can be updated whereas `const` declarations cannot.
- `var` variables can be re-declared whereas `let` and `const` variables cannot.
- All three are hoisted to the top. However, when a `var` declaration is hoisted, it is initialized as `undefined` whereas the `let` and `const` declarations are not initialized.
- While `var` and `let` can be declared without initialization, `const` must be initialized during declaration.
